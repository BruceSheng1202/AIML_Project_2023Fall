# AIML_Project_2023Fall
This is the project detail in the course Artificial Intelligence taught by Dr.Zhonglei Wang in Xiamen University, which solved a problem about sentiment identification in NLP. It's worth mentioning that this course is graduate-leveled. Finally I got 96 in this course.

After that, I added more content to this study and changed it into my undergraduate thesis. The changes include but not limited to traditional sentiment analysis techniques(TF-IDF & Bi-Gram), mainifold learning (Umap) for dimension reduction, etc. Finally I got an A- in undergraduate thesis.
